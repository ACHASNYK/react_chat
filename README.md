Hi! this is a tesk task to build a sample chat-applcation on React with set of basic function - such as list of users, receiveing and posting messages etc.
It imitates real - time conversation process, when you receive a random answer from your correspondent - fetching it remote server.
Build with Firebase firestore , redux and context, also styled-components.

Best regards!
